    <review_text>I have eaten at all the different "big' name Mexican restaurants and that's all they have going for them is their name...and maybe their "big" prices.  Joselito's, by far, is the absolute best!!  Every meal is fresh to order and always served by warm, friendly servers.  All meals are reasonably priced.   It's great for a party of one or for a party of 40.  Joselito's may be family owned business but every customer is treated like family. </review_text>

    <review_text>This spot was recommended to us a few years ago and we have eaten there many times and been happy. However, after not visiting there for awhile my wife and I went there to have lunch this week. I should have known something was up when the waitress didnt know whart Saffron Rice was.. said they didnt have it only white Jasmin rice.. even thought we have had it every time we have gone there.. thought it was a new waitress and moved on.. Also, the Chicken Masala used to come with the chicken on the bone but now it was a bunch of chopped up white meat that tasted a bit old and chewy.. As we were leaving we passed another table of people and I heard the father asking for Saffron rice and getting the same answer I got.. It was then it dawned on me and I asked if there had been a recent ownership change,. The owner said yes. There is nothing worse than a restaurant changing owners and pretending everything is the same when it isnt. Its bait n switch, dishonest and reprehensible for them trying to make customers thing they are crazy for ordering something that every Indian restaurant offers and this one used to..
Shame.. it was a great place.. now off to find a better replacement.. stay away!!!
